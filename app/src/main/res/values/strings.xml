            This PrecomputedText instance can be set on TextView or StaticLayout.
            Since the text layout information will be included in this instance,
            TextView or StaticLayout will not have to recalculate this information.
            Note that the PrecomputedText created from different parameters of the target
            TextView will be rejected internally and compute the text
            layout again with the current TextView parameters.
